          <h3>Team history</h3>
          <p class="compress-text">
            Associazione Calcio Milan, AC Milan is an Italian football & cricket
            club that was founded on 16th December 1899. Milan is the home city
            of the team and shares with Inter the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium Milan,
            San Siro as the home stadium which has a capacity of 80,018
            spectators . The team's colors are black and red and the nickname is
            the Rossoneri (red-black).<br /><br />
            <em
              >"We will be a team of devils. Our colors will be red like fire
              and black like fear, as we will incite our opponents!"</em
            >
            said Herbert Kilpin, one of the club's founders.<br /><br />
            During their time in the Italian leagues, Ac Milan has won a total
            of 20 league titles of which 18 of them are in Serie A and 2 of them
            are in Serie B, but that was most recently in the 1980s. In addition
            to its successes in the Italian league, the team has also won 19
            international trophies, of which the Champions League wins count for
            7 of them (the world's biggest football tournament). <br /><br />In
            1908, a conflict arose within the club, which led to a number of
            members leaving Milan and forming the not entirely unfamiliar FC
            Internazionale Milano, better known as Inter.<br /><br />After
            several decades without a title established Milan as Italy's best
            team in the early 1950s, largely thanks to the Swedish trio
            Gre-No-Li. Between the years 1951 and 1962, they took home no less
            than five titles.
